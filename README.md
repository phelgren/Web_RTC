Demo of photo capture and storage

Nothing special here, move along.....I grabbed some examples from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Taking_still_photos" and also made use of code found here: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/ 

Added some rough logic to store the photo as a BASE64 string in local storage (as a JSON string)

Plan to expand as I can....
